Lunora is a lightweight graphics engine developed for rendering research and experimental graphics studies.
It provides a minimal yet complete rendering pipeline designed to explore real-time rendering techniques without the architectural complexity of large-scale production engines.

### Research Experiments

#### Hemispheric Ambient Lighting vs. Standard Ambient Lighting

A comparative study examining visual and physical differences between hemispheric ambient lighting and standard ambient lighting across different geometries.
