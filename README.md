# Lunora

Lunora is a lightweight graphics engine developed for my graphics research experiments. Its purpose is to provide a clean, minimal core for testing rendering techniques without the complexity of a full engine.

### Current Features

- 3D mesh loading and rendering

- Basic color and lighting shaders

- Window resizing and viewport updates

- Logging

- 24-bit and 32-bit TGA file support

- Texture rendering

- Hemispheric Ambient Lighting

- Ambient Lighting 

This module intentionally includes only essential functionality. Techniques such as shadow mapping, PBR, post-processing, or GPU-driven pipelines will be implemented as separate, dedicated research tasks and added modularly.

### Design Philosophy

Lunora focuses on clarity and simplicity. Instead of embedding every rendering feature into a monolithic system, it provides a small, manageable foundation. New rendering techniques can be attached as independent modules, allowing iterative experimentation without overcomplicating the core.
